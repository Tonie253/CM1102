    <p>Her work has paved the way for processors today. The RISC architecture requires fewef transistors than CISC architecture, for example, making it ideal for light, portable devices. It's used in today's tablets, smartphones and laptops, most notably Apple Products. However, ARM should not be underestimated as it's also used in some supercomputers which consumes large amounts of electricity, as it is a power and cost effective solution.

    It has been updated over the years to now support 32-bit address space and arithmic, which we know is essential in the more modern computer processors. It's managed to evolve with the trend seen in Moore's Law, evolving to become more powerful every year, with the ARMv8-A now supporting 64-bit address space and arithmic. With ARM being the most widely used set architecture, there have been some specialised versions made to include extra capabilities for more specialised work.

    It's not only Apple that has made use of Wilson's designs, but also Android with Android Lollipop (5.0) and later versions supporting ARMv8-A. Chrome OS, Blackberry OS, Firefox OS, Windows Mobile and Windows 10 Mobile are other systems making use of the ARMv8-A. Apple's iOS 10 supported it for a while, but has new been discontinued, however loads of Apple devices are not compatable with that OS and so still makes use of ARMv8-A.
    </p>

    <p>
    ARMv8-A was introduced early 2016 with memory enhancements, better RAS features and an introduction of statistical profiling. Even though this came out 2 years ago, it's still going strong, however we are more than likely to see a newer version or at least an update to it by the start of next year as technology advances.
